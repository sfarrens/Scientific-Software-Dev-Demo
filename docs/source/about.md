# About

!!! warning "Demonstration Package"
    This is a demonstration package created for a course on Scientific Software Development. The package and its documentation are designed to showcase best practices in scientific software development, including documentation, testing, and project structure. This is not a real cosmology package and should not be used in actual research.

`mycosmo` is a Python package designed for cosmological calculations and analysis. The package provides essential tools for working with cosmological parameters and performing fundamental cosmological calculations.

## Scope

The package currently includes:

- Calculation of the Hubble parameter at different redshifts
- Computation of critical density in the universe
- Standard cosmological constants and unit conversions
- Support for various cosmological models through parameter dictionaries

The package is built with scientific computing in mind, utilizing NumPy for efficient numerical operations and providing well-documented functions with clear mathematical formulations. It's particularly useful for:

- Cosmological parameter studies
- Basic cosmological calculations
- Educational purposes in cosmology
- Integration with larger astrophysical analysis pipelines

The code is designed to be modular and extensible, making it easy to add new cosmological functions and calculations as needed.
